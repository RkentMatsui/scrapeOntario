# Ontario Sign Association - Member Directory Scraper README

This repository contains a **Python Selenium scraper** for the Ontario Sign Associationâ€™s Member Directory. It loops through each page in the dropdown, navigates member profiles, extracts details, and exports to a CSV.

## Features
- Uses **Selenium** for JavaScript-rendered content.
- Handles **AJAX-loaded pagination** with robust waits.
- Extracts company name, contact, phone, email, website, address, city, and province/state.
- Outputs `ontario_sign_detailed_profiles.csv`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Google Chrome
- `selenium`, `beautifulsoup4`

## Install
```bash
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4
```

## How to Run
1. Make sure `chromedriver` is installed and matches your Chrome version.
2. Run:
```bash
python scraper.py
```

## How it Works
- **Waits** for the dropdown.
- Loops each `<option>`.
- Collects member links.
- Visits each link and extracts details.

## Notes
